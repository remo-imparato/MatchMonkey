acousticness
float
Acousticness refers to how much of a song or piece of music is made up of natural, organic sounds rather than synthetic or electronic elements. In other words, it's a measure of how "acoustic" a piece of music sounds. A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0, greater value represents higher confidence the track is acoustic.

danceability
float
Danceability is a measure of how suitable a song is for dancing, ranging from 0 to 1. A score of 0 means the song is not danceable at all, while a score of 1 indicates it is highly danceable. This score takes into account factors like tempo, rhythm, beat consistency, and energy, with higher scores indicating stronger, more rhythmically engaging tracks.

energy
float
Energy in music refers to the intensity and liveliness of a track, with a range from 0 to 1. A score of 0 indicates a very calm, relaxed, or low-energy song, while a score of 1 represents a high-energy, intense track. It’s influenced by elements like tempo, loudness, and the overall drive or excitement in the music.

instrumentalness
float
Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.

key
integer
The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C?/D?, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.

liveness
float
Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.

loudness
float
The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.

mode
integer
Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.

speechiness
float
Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.

tempo
float
The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). Values typical range between 0 and 250

valence
float
Valence in music measures the emotional tone or mood of a track, with a range from 0 to 1. A score of 0 indicates a song with a more negative, sad, or dark feeling, while a score of 1 represents a more positive, happy, or uplifting mood. Tracks with a high valence tend to feel joyful or energetic, while those with a low valence may evoke feelings of melancholy or sadness.
